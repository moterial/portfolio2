                    My name is <span>Michael Yeung</span>. My major is <span>Computing</span> and I’m studying it at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I have worked for several months as an IT helper for a few months in a secondary school. Being A member of a team responsible for organizing a drone obstacle course competition and 
                    carried out some daily tasks that an <span>IT helper</span> should do. At last, also an IT support on duty in the Multi-media Learning Center. However, I think only being an IT helper is not enough. Therefore, I want to seek an <span>internship opportunity</span>  to advance my career and gain experience for 
                    my further development. And as a computing student, the school has trained us some programming skills like <span>python, C, and Java</span>. But I don’t think that is enough. Therefore, in last semester break, I have searched and learnt some web development skills and tools like <span>HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
                    and React.js</span>. And try to build <span>a light Instagram-clone using React.js as frontend and firebase as backend</span>. I can say that it is quite fun to learn new things.
